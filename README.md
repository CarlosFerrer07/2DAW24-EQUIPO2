But in case you will do modifications, on the Project, and you will use it on a local server, you have to do the next steps:

1. First of all do the docker-compose up so you can activate the containers doing `docker-compose up` so you can deploy de container and you can activate the containers and the local web server deployed from the containers

2. done,it should be working the whole page, in case you need more news on the page or do some tests with the Back-end profile, remember that there is an admin user that only the client knows.
